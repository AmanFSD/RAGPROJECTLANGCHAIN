This proect implements a question-answering system that reads a PDF, processes its contents, and generates answers based on user queries. It uses LangChainâ€™s PDF loader, OpenAI embeddings, and FAISS for fast document retrieval. The user can interact with the system via a simple menu to ask questions, and the code combines the question with context from the PDF to generate responses using an OpenAI model.
